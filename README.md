This is a log project recording all meet questions during my coding life

## Why this project
- can be accessed easily(anywhere, anytime, and regardless of device as well as internet enviornment)
- take full advantage of google SEO and search engine of github itself
- take full advantage of Label use in Issues to classify
- use the intelligence of internet(everyone may search issues, add issues, and solve issues)

## How to use
- just checkout the issues
- as always, one question per issue, and remember to add a Label on it

## Welcome~
